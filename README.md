## Project Description

Private Mafia Game, also known as Werewolf, is a social deduction party game powered by Web3 technologies. It enhances the classic game with privacy and secure communication features, making it an exciting crypto-powered experience for players. In this 6-player demo lobby game, players must navigate a world where trust is scarce, and every decision can lead to digital riches in the form of testnet tokens.

## Bounties

### WAKU

We have integrated Waku, a secure chat communication tool, to ensure privacy and secure communication between players. This technology enhances the game's overall experience by providing a safe and confidential chat environment.

### PEANUTS PROTOCOL - InProgress

To enable winners to receive their rewards directly to their wallets, we utilize the Peanuts Protocol. This protocol allows us to send money efficiently, from EOA (Externally Owned Account) to EOA, ensuring that players receive their winnings seamlessly.

### BuidlGuidl

Our project's frontend interface is built with BuidlGuidl by forking Scaffold-ETH. This framework enables us to create a user-friendly and visually appealing frontend that enhances the overall gaming experience.

### BASE - InProgress

We have chosen Base Goerli as our testnet, as it provides an excellent environment for receiving Peanut Protocol payments as game rewards. This choice ensures that players can test and enjoy the game with ease on a stable testnet.
